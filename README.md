# H2OInsight

This project was my final project for my university's database management system course. Tho this was a group project I wrote all of the Python, MySQL and most of the frontend by myself. This repo is to save and show what I did. There was more to this project then just coding IE (literature review, rich picture, ERD ...) witch is incluted in the final paper made by us. Also included is a video demo of the project runing.
