# H2OInsight

This project was my final project for my university's database management system course. Tho this was a group project I wrote all of the Python, MySQL and most of the frontend by myself. This repo is to save and show what I did. There was more to this project then just coding IE (literature review, rich picture, ERD ...) witch is incluted in the final paper made by us.

H2OInsight is a web app where users can add and compare water quality data. Researchers can add different locations then add water quality data for those locations.  Viewers can search, view and compare data between different locations and data between the same locations with different dates.

The app has an Admin dashboard, it also has support tickets where users can submit their problems and message the admins.

Techstack - 
HTML, CSS as the forentend.
Flask as its backend. 
MySQL as its database.

Honest thoughts - 
The project is really simple. It has a simple database, simple UI and simple functionality, repetitive code.  it's nothing to write home about. But I learned quite a lot. 

Stuff I learned - 
This is my first time using MySQL. Got to learn about it and MySQL workbench.
Gained a better understanding of Flask.
